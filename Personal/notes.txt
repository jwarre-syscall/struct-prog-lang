regular expressions
> '()' ~ groups a series of pattern elements to a single element
> '|' ~ separates alternate possibilities
    Example:
        $string1 = "Hello World\n";
        if ($string1 =~ m/(Hello|Hi|Pogo)/) 
        {
            print "$string1 contains at least one of Hello, Hi, or Pogo.";
        }

    Output:
        Hello World
         contains at least one of Hello,
        Hi, or Pogo.
> '.' ~ normally matches any character except a newline
> '*' ~ matches the preceding pattern element zero or more times
> '+' ~ matches the preceding pattern element one or more times
> '\\'
> '\d' ~ matches a digit
> '\D' ~ matches a non-digit
> '\s' ~ matches a whitespace character
> '\n' ...
> '\t' ...
> '\S' ~ matches anything but a whitespace

    Two Questions 
        - Is there a end condition?
        - Is the problem getting smaller?
